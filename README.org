* Thinkpad X220 BIOS
Unmodified export of my ThinkpadX220 taken prior to corebooting.

* Version Information
UEFI BIOS Version: 8DET56WW (1.26)
UEFI BIOS Date (2011-12-01)
Embedded Controller Version: 8DHT29WW (1.13)
Machine Type Model: 42918G1

* Why are there two binaries?
My flasher reported there being two chips to read data from. Both chips are the
same i guess. The MD5sums of the files matched. The chip that I flashed coreboot
to is the one named "w25q64bv-w25q64cv-w25q64fv"
